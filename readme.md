## Synopsis

This network pentesting tool merges and displays the data gathered from standard network tools like, tcpdump, traceroute, nmap, etc

An automated python script runs all these tools sequentially and processes their output to a json file. A lightweight html page renders the json file and allows to display, sort and filter its content.

## Code Example

The data gathering is coded in python with minimum reliance on external libraries: json, re and subprocess.

The data displaying relies mostly on the [D3.js](https://d3js.org/) library. Tables and graphs are rendered from the content of the json file generated by the python script.

## Motivation

For my OSCP certification I needed an easy way of merging, displaying, filtering and sorting the data obtained from different network pentesting tools.

## Installation

- Download files
- Run python script as sudo. Without sudo half of the pentesting tools won't work properly
- Open the index.html in any web browser
- Repeat at will
